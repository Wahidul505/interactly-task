# Interactly Task


## [Live Link](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features and Functionalities:

* I created the project with React JS, Redux and Tailwind.
* To play video, I created my own custom video player without using any external library for video player.
* I used Redux to store the active page states and also based on that I implemented styles.
* In video player, except the subtitle I implemented all the tools and functionalities.
* I tried to implemented end to end design as same as the given page.


## Thank You
